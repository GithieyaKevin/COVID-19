COVID-19 Data Analysis Project


Project Title: "COVID-19 Pandemic: Data Cleaning, Analysis & Visualization"



This project explores global COVID-19 data to analyze trends, infection rates, and vaccination progress. Using Python, I cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to uncover patterns and insights about the pandemic's impact.

Objectives of the Project
Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in COVID-19 datasets.

Standardize date formats and normalize country names.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Compute key statistics (total cases, deaths, recovery rates).

Compare infection trends across countries.

Data Visualization

Plot time-series trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Compare infection rates between regions.

Analyze vaccination progress vs. case fatality rates.

Key Insights Extraction

Identify worst-affected countries.

Examine the impact of vaccination campaigns.

Detect waves of infections (peaks and declines).

Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Primary Language)

Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy → Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

Datetime → Handling date formats

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive analysis

How to Run/View the Project
Prerequisites:

Install Python (≥3.8)

Required libraries:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Running the Project:

Download the dataset.

Open Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Run each cell in the notebook step-by-step.

Expected Outputs:

Cleaned CSV files (if exported).

Interactive plots (line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps).

Key Insights & Reflections
Insights from Data:
✔ Global Waves: Identified three major COVID-19 waves (2020, 2021, 2022).
✔ Vaccination Impact: Countries with higher vaccination rates had lower fatality rates in later waves.
✔ Regional Variations: South America & Europe had higher death rates compared to Oceania.

Challenges Faced:
 Data Inconsistencies: Missing values and data required interpolation.
 Date Formatting: Different datasets used varying date formats.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data cleaning, analysis, and visualization can reveal critical insights into a global crisis like COVID-19. The findings could help policymakers assess response strategies and prepare for future outbreaks.
